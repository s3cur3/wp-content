Because The Modern Law Firm is designed to ***exactly* meet the needs of an law firm's Web site**, it is **10&times; times easier** to get the *exact* site you want.

No need to tinker for hours to get the design you want---**this theme "just works."**


## Fully responsive design

21% of consumers use smartphones to search for an attorney.

If you want to get more clients from your Web site, you need a design that plays nice with mobile devices.

The Modern Law Firm theme adapts to the screen size of whatever device you're using. Visitors get a great experience whether they're on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone.



## Retina ready

Make sure your firm looks great, whether your prospects are checking you out from an iPad, iPhone, or desktop.

This theme makes it easy to use Retina-sized images---it even supports using a vector (SVG) logo.


## Powerful, easy-to-use theme customization.

The Theme Options Panel allows you to quickly customize the theme, including:

- the color theme,
- the fonts,
- the layout,
- the page backgrounds,
- and more!



## Great-looking image slider

The theme bundles a free, easy-to-use image slider.

You can insert slides at the top of a page (like your home page) or within any page.

That means that what you see in the page editor is what it will look like when you publish.


## 10 color themes (or create your own)

The Modern Law Firm theme includes 10 color themes.

You can easily tweak these color themes to match your own brand, or create a 100% custom color theme.


## Search engine optimized

The theme is designed using SEO best practices, so that you get the most traffic possible out of your Web presence.

We use Schema.org markup (a.k.a. microformats or structured data) to enhance your site's results in the search engines, and we support the Yoast SEO plugin for enhanced SEO.


## Comprehensive documentation & demo data

The bundled sample WordPress data makes it easy to get up and running quickly.

If you get stuck, the documentation can walk you through every step of recreating the demo site.

## Easy social media integration

The Modern Law Firm makes it easy to add links to your firm's social media accounts, both in the page header and the sidebar. It 


## Based on Twitter Bootstrap
